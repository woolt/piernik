!! \brief Things that should be common for all refinement criteria.
!!
!! \details The refinement criteria are meant to be ordered into a unidirectional list.
!! For each grid container the routines for marking refinements are called in the same order.
!! It is assumed that all vital fields will have valid boundaries for the routine mark.
!! Each criterion should be applicable on any cg and no global communication should take place in this routine.
!! Refinement criteria that require some global operations (like Toomre length in disks)
!! should be implemented separately and used with care.
